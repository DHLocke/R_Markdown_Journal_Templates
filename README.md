# R_Markdown_Journal_Templates
Rmarkdown is useful for integrating reproducible R code into manuscripts. Journal manuscript formats vary. The goal of this repository is to have place for journal-specific formatted Rmarkdown files.

Paper templates with required headings and (suggested) sub-heading specific to certain journals' formating needs will be created and stored here. Users are encouraged to download and use these templates to help accelerate creating their own manuscripts for peer review. Ideally users will also modify and adapt existing templates to meet the needs of other journals' requirements. Naturally journals formats will change.

There is absolutely no guarantee that the volunteered templates will 100% meet the submission requirements of your chosen journal.

The system is based the workflow presented by Richard Layton in a blog post called *Happy collaboration with Rmd to docx*  [link here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html). Edits to formating are made in Word, and the associated Rmd file points to that Word Document for formatting.

Please consider adding a template here for your next journal submission!

You could save someone else - maybe a future version of **you** - considerable time by improving the workflow.

Currently there are templates for the following journals:

| Abbreviation | Journal name | Link to site |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LAUP | Landscape and Urban Planning | https://www.elsevier.com/journals/landscape-and-urban-planning/0169-2046?generatepdf=true |
| UECO | Urban Ecosystems | https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/ecology/journal/11252 |
| UFUG | Urban Forestry & Urban Greening | https://www.elsevier.com/journals/urban-forestry-and-urban-greening/1618-8667?generatepdf=true |

See the "Journals" folder above.
